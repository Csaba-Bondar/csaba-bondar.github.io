    About me

<p>I spent most of my life in a dental laboratory. In order to develop the dental technician profession, I started learning CAD-CAM design,
    which also requires attention to detail in order to implement the precise design of dental works. Acquiring new knowledge and
    the expansion of the professional palette resulted in me thinking about creating a nice website for the nearly 40-year-old lab.
    Well, after walking down this path, I found this awesome team. 
     </p>

     <p>Right now I am begginer in the IT, in the future I am going to use:
        HTML, CSS, Python, C#, AWS/Azure
     </p>

     <p>Work:
        Tip-Dent Laboratory, Orient Crown and Bridge Laboratory, Innovate Dental Laboratory
